  abstract = {In applied multivariate statistics, estimating the number of latent dimensions or the number of clusters is a fundamental and recurring problem. One common diagnostic is the scree plot, which shows the largest eigenvalues of the data matrix in decreasing order; the user searches for a ``gap'' or ``elbow'' in the decaying eigenvalues; unfortunately, these patterns can hide beneath the bias of the sample eigenvalues. This methodological problem is conceptually difficult because, in many situations, there is only enough signal to detect a subset of the k population dimensions/eigenvectors. In this situation, one could argue that the correct choice of k is the number of detectable dimensions. We alleviate these problems with cross-validated eigenvalues. Under a large class of random graph models, without any parametric assumptions, we provide a p-value for each sample eigenvector. It tests the null hypothesis that this sample eigenvector is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the true latent dimensions. This approach naturally adapts to problems where some dimensions are not statistically detectable. In scenarios where all k dimensions can be estimated, we prove that our procedure consistently estimates k. In simulations and a data example, the proposed estimator compares favorably to alternative approaches in both computational and statistical performance.},

  abstract = {Understanding why interventions work is essential to optimizing them. Although mechanistic theories of meditation-based interventions (MBIs) exist, empirical evidence is limited. We randomly assigned 662 adults (79.9\% reported clinical levels of anxiety or depressive symptoms) to a 4-week smartphone-based MBI or wait-list control condition early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological distress and four theory-driven preregistered psychological mediators of well-being (mindful action, loneliness, cognitive defusion, and purpose) were assessed five times during the intervention period and at 3-month follow-up. In preregistered analyses, assignment to the intervention predicted significant gains on all mediators, which, in turn, significantly mediated follow-up distress (21.9\%--62.5\% of intervention effect on distress). No significant mediation pathway was observed in an exploratory multiple mediator analysis, but reduced loneliness accounted for 61.7\% of the combined indirect effect. Multiple psychological pathways may mediate reduced distress in a digital MBI.},
